# Llama-index
Llama-index is a simple framework for connecting custom data sources to LLM's(Large Language Models).

## Key Tools:-
- _**Data Ingestion**_:
It provides you lot of libraries to connect with external data of different sources.(API's,PDF's,documents,SQL,etc.)

- _**Data Indexing**_:-
Store and index your data for differnet use cases.
Integrate with downsteam vector store and database providers.

- _**Query Interface**_:-
from that index whenever your are putting a query you will get a response,
as it provides a query interface that accepts any input prompt over your data and returns a knowledge-augmented response.

### Can Connect To:-
1. Unstructured Data:-
- Connect unstructured sources such as documents,raw text files,PDF's,videos,images,etc.
(Ppt's,pdf's,youtube,docs)

2. Structured Data:-
- Easily integrate Structured data sources such as documents,raw text files,PDF's,videos,images,etc.
(Excel,Sql)

3. Semi-Structured Data:-
- Connect Semi-Structured data from API's like Slack,Salesforce,Notion,etc.
(Notion,Salesforce,Slack)
